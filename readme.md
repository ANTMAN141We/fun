The Y8 Flash browser is a Chromium based browser packaged with the Adobe Flash Player. As old rendering technologies that created decades long worth of games get removed from Chrome, this is a way to preseve that browser games history. While modern HTML5 and WebGl also play well in this browser, the main idea is to keep those Flash games playable for as long as possible. Available for all major desktops like Winodws, MacOS, Linux.
